# SQLite-Database

SQLite Database and Pets Insights
This project involves using SQL queries on a SQLite database called petsdb to analyze data about individuals and their pets. The goal was to extract insights related to pet ownership, treatment records, and demographic patterns. By utilizing Python’s sqlite3 library, the database was connected, and various SQL queries were executed to explore the data.

Key findings from this analysis include the distribution of individuals by age, with the most common age being 73 years old. Additionally, 43 people in the dataset own more than one pet, and 60 individuals are missing last names. The project also focused on pet treatment data, revealing that 36 pets have received treatment, with 16 of these pets having a known pet type. Furthermore, the geographic distribution of pets showed that 49 pets are from the city of East Port, and 11 of these pets have received treatment.

This project demonstrates the use of SQL to query and analyze structured data, combined with Python for database management and automation. The insights gained provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between individuals, their pets, and the factors affecting pet care. Python’s sqlite3 library was used to efficiently interact with the database, and SQL queries were structured to answer specific questions about the data.

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed with the sqlite3 library, and clone the repository to execute the Python scripts that perform the database analysis.
